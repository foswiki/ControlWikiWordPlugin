---++ Usage

This plugin provides 4 functions:
   * Rules-based blocking of WikiWord linking backwards compatible to the !StopWikiWordPlugin 
   * Limit linking of Acronyms to the first instance in a topic.
   * !Singleton WikiWord linking backwards compatible to the !SingletonWikiWordPlugin
   * Regular Expression rules-based Singleton WikiWord linking (Configurable only by system administrator)

All functions are disabled by default unless explicitly enabled.

-----
---+++ Rules-based blocking of WikiWord linking
_Originally implemented in the !StopWikiWordPlugin_

In this mode, the Plugin prevents automatic linking of selected [[%SYSTEMWEB%.WikiWord][WikiWords]] such as <nop>LinuxWorld or <nop>MacDonald.

---++++ Configuration
!WikiWords that should not be automatically linked are listed in a STOPWIKIWORDLINK preferences setting. This is typically done in the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]], but can be done also in any web (in %WEBPREFSTOPIC%), in the User topic for personal preferences, or in a single topic. See sample entry in the Plugin settings.

%X% Note: Global settings are _not_ read from this topic.

   * Add a STOPWIKIWORDLINK setting to the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] topic, listing all !WikiWords to exclude from auto-linking. Example:
<verbatim>  
   * Set STOPWIKIWORDLINK = LinuxWorld, MacDonald
</verbatim>

---++++ Examples
   * Test if the installation was successful. The following words will not be linked in this topic. (The above setting needs to be copied to one of the preferences locations to activate for other webs or topics.): 
      * LinuxWorld, MacDonald

-----
---+++ Acronym Linking Control
_Adapted from the Acronym limits provided by the !FindElsewherePlugin_

In addition to WikiWords, Foswiki will auto-link Acronyms - any string
consisting of 3 or more upper-case letters and numbers. WikiWords are always
linked - displaying a question mark if the topic does not exist.  Acronyms
however only link when the topic exists.

In some technical
topics, this can result in excessive linking.  This feature will limit
acronym links to only the first occurrence of an acronym in a topic.  Forced
[<nop>[link]]  however will always be honored. 

---++++ Configuration

To limit Acronym linking, add the CONTROLWIKIWORDPLUGIN_LIMITACRONYMS setting
to the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] topic or in any web in %WEBPREFSTOPIC%, or in user
or individual topics. This mode of operation is not enabled by default.  (This
setting can be abbreviated as simply =LIMITACRONYMS=.)

<verbatim>  
   * Set CONTROLWIKIWORDPLUGIN_LIMITACRONYMS = 1
</verbatim>

---++++ Examples
HTML is an example of an ACRONYM, as is RSS.   If an ACRONYM occurs twice, only
the first instance will be linked.  

---+++ Singleton<nop>WikiWordPlugin compatible operation
_Originally implemented in the !SingletonWikiWordPlugin_

In this mode, the plugin will interpret that a single word is a reference to a Foswiki Topic of that name. To create a Singleton link, write a dot before the topic name. For example, if you have a topic named _Ontology_ you can link to it as _<nop><strong>.</strong>Ontology_ This adds a simpler way to force a single word link. You can already accomplish the same thing by enclosing the word in double square brackets, like this: <nop>[<nop>[Ontology]]

The syntax was chosen to be an extension of the _Web.Topic_ syntax. The syntax does not support topic names qualified with the web name. So to link to _Ontology_ in a different web than the current web, you need to use the square-bracket mode of forcing the links, [%NOP%[Support.Ontology][Support.Ontology]]

---++++ Configuration
To enable backwards compatible operation with the TWiki !SingletonWikiWordPlugin, Add the CONTROLWIKIWORDPLUGIN_DOTSINGLETONENABLE setting to the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] topic or in any web in %WEBPREFSTOPIC%, or in user or individual topics. This mode of operation is not enabled by default.

<verbatim>  
   * Set CONTROLWIKIWORDPLUGIN_DOTSINGLETONENABLE = 1
</verbatim>

---++++ Examples

| *As Written* | *Should appear as* | *If installed* | 
| .<nop>Singleword | [[Singleword]]  | .Singleword | 

-----
---+++ Regular Expression rules-based WikiWords

This feature has no !WikiUser configurable features. The System Administrator can set regular expression rules in the Foswiki Configuration that will match topic names useful for your configuration. Examples might include bug tracking link on http://foswiki.org/Support, where question topics are the word _Question_ followed by a 3-5 digit number.
   * The sample configuration will provide a link for Question123 FAQ22, Item123 and Item1244, but not ATask123.  
      * But Task123A is matched as a normal WikiWord and not by this plugin.
   * Forced links containing a Singleton link in the link text are not broken:  [[System.Question123][Forced link to Question123 in System Web]]
   * Neither are <a href=http://foswiki.org/Support/Question123> HTML Link to Question123 in Foswiki.org</a>
   * <noautolink> &lt;noautolink&gt; blocks are honored Question123 &lt;/noautolink&gt; </noautolink>

---++++ Configuration

The system administrator uses the =bin/configure= interface to set one or more Regular Expressions to find Singleton !WikiWords that should be converted to links. The configuration is a hash of a Regular Expression, and the web that
should be linked. ={qr/Regular Expression/,'Webname'}= If the webname is not provided, the link will be for the web of the topic containing the matching word.
The plugin performs case-sensitive matching.  

%X% *Caution:* Syntax errors in =LocalSite.cfg= can render the site non-operational.  This is an *Expert* level perl language configuration and should be approached with caution!

---+++++!! Sample Configuration:
<verbatim>
 {Plugins}{ControlWikiWordPlugin}{SingletonWords} = {
     '(?:Item[[:digit:]]{3,6})' => 'Tasks'
     '(?:Question[[:digit:]]{3,5}|FAQ[[:digit:]]{1,3})' => 'Support'
     '(?:Plugins)' => ''
     }; 
</verbatim>
Will perform the following links:
<noautolink>
   $ =='(?:Item[%NOP%[:digit:]]{3,6}) => 'Tasks'==: Match the word _Item_ followed by a 3-6 digit number.  If found, create a link to the topic of that name in the Tasks web.
   $ =='(?:Question[%NOP%[:digit:]]{3,5}|FAQ[%NOP%[:digit:]]{1,3}) => 'Support'==: Match either _Question_, followed by a 3-5 digit number, or _FAQ_ followed by a 1-3 digit number.  If found create a link to the topic of that name in the Support web.
   $ =='(?:Plugins)' => ''==: Link any instance of the word _Plugins_ to a topic of that name in the current web.  (If the Web portion of the rule is empty, the link will point to the current web where the Singleton !WikiWord was
   found.)
</noautolink>

---++++ Examples

The following examples will function only if the sample configuration above
has been set using the =bin/configure= interface by the systems administrator.
Note that all links except for the last example will typically result in "missing
topic" links with the "?".

| *As Written* | *Should appear as* | *If Installed* | *Notes* | 
| <nop>Item123 | [[Tasks.Item123][Item123]] | Item123 | Link points to Tasks Web |
| <nop>Question234 | [[Support.Question123][Question234]] | Question234 | Link points to Support Web |
| <nop>FAQ23 | [[Support.FAQ23][FAQ23]] | FAQ23 | Link points to Support Web |
| <nop>Plugins | [[Plugins]] | Plugins | Links to Plugins topic in System Web |
<!--
The =(?-xism= string means as follows:   =(?-= A grouping of characters, with
modifiers. The - "negates" or turns off the following options:
   * x - Extended (non-matching) white space in the expression
   * i - Case insensitive, so -i means case sensitive.
   * sm - The dot will match anything including newlines, while ^ and $ will match before or after embedded newlines within the string.
