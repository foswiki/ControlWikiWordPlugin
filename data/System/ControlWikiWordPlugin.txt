---++ Usage

This plugin provides 3 functions: 
   * Regular Expression rules-based Singleton WikiWord linking
   * Rules-based blocking of WikiWord linking backwards compatible to the !StopWikiWordPlugin
   * !Singleton WikiWord linking backwards compatible to the !SingletonWikiWordPlugin

---+++ Regular Expression rules-based WikiWords

This feature has no WikiUser configurable features.  The System Administrator
can set regular expression rules in the Foswiki Configuration that will match
topic names useful for your configuration.   Examples might include bug
tracking link on http://foswiki.org/Tasks, where Task topics are the word
_Task_ followed by a 3-5 digit number.

The sample configuration will provide a link for Question123

---+++ Rules-based blocking of WikiWord linking

In this mode, the Plugin prevents automatic linking of selected [[%SYSTEMWEB%.WikiWord][WikiWords]] such as <nop>LinuxWorld or <nop>MacDonald.

!WikiWords that should not be automatically linked are listed in a
STOPWIKIWORDLINK preferences setting.  This is typically done in the
[[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]], but can be done also in any web (in %WEBPREFSTOPIC%), in
the User topic for personal preferences, or in a single topic. See sample entry in the Plugin settings.

%X% Note:  Settings are _not_ read from this topic.

   * Add a STOPWIKIWORDLINK setting to the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] topic, listing all !WikiWords to exclude from auto-linking. Example:
<verbatim>  
   * Set STOPWIKIWORDLINK = LinuxWorld, MacDonald
</verbatim>

   * Test if the installation was successful. The following words should not be linked when above example is used:
      * LinuxWorld, MacDonald

---+++ SingletonWikiWordPlugin compatible operation

This designates that a single word is a reference to a single word. To show
Foswiki that it should be linked to, write a dot before it.

Hence if you have the WikiWord Ontology you can link to it as <nop>.Ontology

In fact, you can already force a single word link to a WikiWord by enclosing
it in double square brackets, like this:
<nop>[<nop>[Ontology]]

This plugin allows you to write it without the square brackets.

The syntax was chosen to be an extension of the Web.Topic syntax

Test:
| *Written as* | *Test* | *If it is installed properly you see* | *If it
isn't, you will see* |
| .Singleword | .Singleword  | [[Singleword]] | <nop>.Singleword |
