---++ Usage

This plugin provides 3 functions:
   * Regular Expression rules-based Singleton WikiWord linking (Configurable only by system administrator)
   * Rules-based blocking of WikiWord linking backwards compatible to the !StopWikiWordPlugin (Configurable by any user)
   * !Singleton WikiWord linking backwards compatible to the !SingletonWikiWordPlugin

---+++ Regular Expression rules-based WikiWords

This feature has no !WikiUser configurable features. The System Administrator can set regular expression rules in the Foswiki Configuration that will match topic names useful for your configuration. Examples might include bug tracking link on http://foswiki.org/Support, where question topics are the word _Question_ followed by a 3-5 digit number.
   * The sample configuration will provide a link for Question123
   * Forced links are not broken [[System.Question123][Forced link to Question123 in System Web]]
   * And <a href=http://foswiki.org/Support/Question123> HTML Link to Question123 in Foswiki.org</a> are not broken

<noautolink> &lt;noautolink&gt; sections are honored Question456 &lt;/noautolink&gt; </noautolink>
---++++ Configuration

The system administrator uses the =bin/configure= interface to set one or more Regular Expressions to find Singleton !WikiWords that should be converted to links. The configuration is a list of pairs - a Regular Expression, and the web that should be linked. For example, the following configuration will link any occurrence of =Question= followed by a 3-5 digit number, such as =Question123= to the link =[%NOP%[Support.Question123]]=

<verbatim>
  {ControlWikiWordPlugin}{SingletonWords} = "Question[[:digit:]]{3,5}","Support"
</verbatim>

If the Web portion of the rule is empty, the link will point to the current web where the Singleton !WikiWord was found.

---+++ Rules-based blocking of WikiWord linking

In this mode, the Plugin prevents automatic linking of selected [[%SYSTEMWEB%.WikiWord][WikiWords]] such as <nop>LinuxWorld or <nop>MacDonald.

---++++ Configuration
!WikiWords that should not be automatically linked are listed in a STOPWIKIWORDLINK preferences setting. This is typically done in the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]], but can be done also in any web (in %WEBPREFSTOPIC%), in the User topic for personal preferences, or in a single topic. See sample entry in the Plugin settings.

%X% Note: Global settings are _not_ read from this topic.

   * Add a STOPWIKIWORDLINK setting to the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] topic, listing all !WikiWords to exclude from auto-linking. Example:
<verbatim>  
   * Set STOPWIKIWORDLINK = LinuxWorld, MacDonald
</verbatim>

---++++ Examples
   * Test if the installation was successful. The following words will not be linked in this topic. (The above setting needs to be copied to one of the preferences locations to activate for other webs or topics.): 
      * LinuxWorld, MacDonald

---+++ Singleton<nop>WikiWordPlugin compatible operation

This designates that a single word is a reference to a single word. To show Foswiki that it should be linked to, write a dot before it.

Hence if you have the WikiWord Ontology you can link to it as <nop>.Ontology

In fact, you can already force a single word link to a WikiWord by enclosing it in double square brackets, like this: <nop>[<nop>[Ontology]]

This plugin allows you to write it without the square brackets.

The syntax was chosen to be an extension of the Web.Topic syntax

---++++ Configuration

To enable backwards compatible operation with the TWiki !SingletonWikiWordPlugin, Add the CONTROLWIKIWORDPLUGIN_DOTSINGLETONENABLE setting to the [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] topic or in any web in %WEBPREFSTOPIC%, or in user or individual topics.

<verbatim>  
   * Set CONTROLWIKIWORDPLUGIN_DOTSINGLETONENABLE = 1
</verbatim>

---++++ Examples

Test:
| *Written as* | *Test* | *If it is installed properly you see* | *If it isn't, you will see* |
| .<nop>Singleword | .Singleword  | [[Singleword]] | <nop>.Singleword |
